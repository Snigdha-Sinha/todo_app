The Product Qualification Specification document outlines the testing objectives, methodologies, 
test cases, and acceptance criteria for the Menu-Driven Todo App. By adhering to these 
specifications, we aim to ensure that the application meets the required quality standards and 
delivers a seamless user experience.

Introduction
===================

The Product Qualification Specification (PQS) document outlines the testing criteria and 
procedures to ensure that the Menu-Driven Todo App meets the required quality standards and 
functional expectations.

Objectives
===================

* Verify that the application functions according to the specified requirements.
* Identify and address any defects or issues in the application.
* Ensure that the application meets performance, usability, and reliability standards.

Testing Scope
===================

The testing will cover all aspects of the Menu-Driven Todo App, including:

* Adding, modifying, deleting, and viewing tasks.
* User interface usability and responsiveness.
* Error handling and recovery mechanisms.

Testing Methodologies
========================

* **Functional Testing**: Verify that all functional requirements are implemented correctly.
* **Usability Testing**: Assess the user interface for ease of navigation and clarity.
* **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the application's responsiveness and efficiency under various load conditions.
* **Error Handling Testing**: Test the application's ability to handle and recover from errors gracefully.
