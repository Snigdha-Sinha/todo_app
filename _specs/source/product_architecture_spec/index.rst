Product Architecture Specification
****************************************

Introduction
================================
The Product Architecture Specification Document provides a comprehensive overview of the design and implementation considerations for the Menu-Driven Todo App. It outlines the architecture's key aspects, including constraints, context, solution strategy, building blocks, runtime behavior, deployment options, crosscutting concepts, architectural decisions, quality requirements, risks, technical debt, and glossary of key terms.

Introduction and Goals
================================
The Menu-Driven Todo App aims to offer users a straightforward and efficient tool for task management through a user-friendly menu interface. The architecture prioritizes usability, performance, and reliability while facilitating easy maintenance and extensibility of the application.

Constraints
================================

- The application is developed using the Python programming language.
- It operates within a single session and does not support user authentication or persistent storage of tasks.
- Due dates must adhere to a specific format (e.g., DD.MM) to ensure proper handling by the application.

Context and Scope
================================

The application operates in a standalone environment, providing task management functionality to individual users. It is designed to be lightweight and intuitive, catering to users seeking a simple solution for organizing their tasks effectively.

Solution Strategy
================================

The architecture adopts a layered structure, comprising presentation, application, and data layers. The presentation layer offers a user interface with menu-driven interactions, while the application layer manages task operations. The data layer stores task data during the application session. Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented across layers to ensure application integrity.

Building Block View
================================

- **Presentation Layer**: User Interface, Input Validation
- **Application Layer**: Task Management Service, Error Handling
- **Data Layer**: Task Repository

Runtime View
================================

During runtime, the application processes user interactions through the presentation layer, delegates task management operations to the application layer, and accesses task data from the data layer. Error handling mechanisms intercept and handle errors at various stages to maintain application integrity.

Deployment View
================================

The application can be deployed on any platform supporting Python. Deployment options include local deployment for standalone usage or deployment on a cloud platform for accessibility across multiple devices. It is packaged as a standalone executable or as a Python script for easy deployment.

Crosscutting Concepts
================================

- **Usability**: Ensure the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Performance**: Maintain fast response times and efficient task management operations.
- **Reliability**: Handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to detect and recover from errors effectively.

Architectural Decisions
============================

- **Python Language**: Chosen for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries.
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Adopted to provide users with a straightforward interaction model.
- **Layered Architecture**: Implemented to separate concerns and facilitate maintainability.
- **In-Memory Data Storage**: Utilized for storing task data during runtime, simplifying deployment.

Quality Requirements
============================

- **Usability**: Ensure an intuitive user interface catering to users with varying expertise.
- **Performance**: Maintain fast response times even with a large task list.
- **Reliability**: Ensure consistent performance and data integrity.
- **Maintainability**: Design for easy maintenance and extensibility.

Risks and Technical Debt
============================

- **Performance Issues**: Potential bottlenecks may require optimization strategies.
- **User Authentication**: Lack of authentication introduces security risks.
- **Technical Debt**: Rapid development may lead to accumulated technical debt.

Glossary
============================

- **Menu-Driven Todo App**: Application facilitating task management through a user-friendly interface.
- **Task**: Unit of work managed within the application.
- **Python**: Versatile programming language used for development.
- **In-Memory Data Storage**: Method of storing data within the application's memory.
