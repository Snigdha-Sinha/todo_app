Product Integration Specification
****************************************

Introduction
========================
The Product Integration Specification document delineates the integration requisites and procedures necessary for the seamless functioning of the Menu-Driven Todo App. It elucidates how the diverse components of the application will be merged to ensure cohesive functionality and optimal performance.

Objectives
========================
* Establish integration points between the frontend and backend components of the application.
* Define data exchange formats and communication protocols between components.
* Outline testing methodologies for integration testing to validate component interoperability.

Integration Points
========================
* **Frontend** (User Interface):
  - Manages user inputs and displays task details.
* **Backend** (Task Management Service):
  - Orchestrates task operations including addition, modification, deletion, and viewing.
* **Data Layer** (Task Repository):
  - Persists task data throughout the application session.

Integration Strategies
========================
* Direct Function Call Integration:
  - Implement function calls between frontend and backend components for real-time interaction.
  - Utilize Python's inherent data structures for seamless task data exchange between components.

Integration Testing
========================
* **Unit Testing**:
  - Verify individual component functionalities (frontend, backend, data layer) in isolation.
* **Integration Testing**:
  - Validate the interaction between frontend and backend components to ensure smooth data exchange and behavior.
  - Confirm integration points and data flow between components across various scenarios.

Integration Environment
========================
* Create an integration environment mirroring the production setup.
* Employ mock data and simulated user interactions for testing integration scenarios.

Integration Plan
========================
* Formulate a detailed integration plan encompassing frontend, backend, and data layer component integration.
* Assign integration tasks to team members with clearly defined responsibilities and timelines.

Acceptance Criteria
========================
* Successful integration of frontend and backend components sans errors or data loss.
* Demonstration of component interoperability through integration testing.
* Adherence to prescribed data exchange formats and protocols.
