## Using the Command-line Menu-driven App

- When running `main.py`, a menu of options is displayed as follows:

    ```
    What do you want to do?   
        1. Add a new task
        2. Modify an existing task
        3. Delete a task
        4. View the todo list
        5. Quit
        Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 
    ```

    The user should input their choice when prompted.

- For each option, the app will request the necessary values from the user.
- Users are simply required to follow the prompts as the Todo App manages task tracking.
