## Features of the App

- The Todo app offers basic functionalities including:
    - Adding tasks to the todo list
    - Deleting tasks from the list
    - Marking tasks as completed
    - Viewing the complete list
- The Todo list is segmented into two sub-lists:
    - Pending tasks list
    - Completed tasks list
- Each task encompasses the following properties:
    - Task name
    - Category (work, personal, etc.)
    - Due date
    - Priority (low, medium, high)
    - Completion status (initially set to <i>False</i>)
- An additional feature allows users to modify the content of an existing task.
- Upon completion, users can modify the task's completion status, transitioning it from the <i>pending tasks list</i> to the <i>completed tasks list</i>.
